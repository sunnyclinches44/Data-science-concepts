## What is the basic formula of Probability?

Probability is that how likely an event can occur. if we take event as 'A' then below is the basic formula. The probability value is always between 0 and 1.

Example: The likelihood of getting the number "6" in throwing a die. It is P(A)=1/6.

## What is the experiment in Probability?

An experiment is recording the number of trails and has a well defined set of outcomes. 

## What is the favorable outcome?

Favorable outcome is the positive outcome of an event.

## What is the sample space?

In probability theory, the sample space of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of an experiment.

## What is the experimental probability?

In probability theory, the experimental probability is the ratio of number of times an event occurs to the total number of trails or times the activity performed.

## What is the expected value?

In probability theory, expected value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure repeated many times. We can compute the expected value by multiplying each outcome by the probability of that outcome, then adding up the products.
