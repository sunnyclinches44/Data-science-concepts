## PEGA - Concepts

### What are the steps involved in the model preparation? 

1. Data Preparation - Critical step in the model preparation
  - Source Selection: 
      Select data either using the CSV, Database 
  - Sample Construction: 
      Select the appropriate fields - Categorical or Numerical
      Discard the fields that are not useful. For example, customer id etc...
      Select the hold-out sets that include Validation and Test Sets
  - Outcome definition
      Decide the outcome to be predicted - whether it is a scoring model or spectrum model. 
      Scoring Model - Categorical model like true, and false. Like the prediction belongs to which category
      Spectrum Model - Numerical range. Like predicting the house prices

3. Model Development
4. Model Analysis
5. Model Selection
