# Combinatorics

## What is the Combanatorics?

Combinatorics can help us count the number of orders in which something can happen.

Example: In a classroom, there are 3 different pupil and 3 different chairs then in a row. In how many different orders can the pupils sit on these chairs?

3! = 3* 2 * 1 = 6 (different ways they can sit on the chairs)
